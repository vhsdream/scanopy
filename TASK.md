# Task: Fix Browser RAM Leak (#424)

## Objective

Fix excessive RAM consumption (6GB+) in the Scanopy web UI, particularly during discovery sessions.

## Background

Users report a single browser tab consuming 6GB+ RAM, especially during discovery. One user reported Chrome using 16GB and eventually crashing with SIGILL.

## Root Causes Identified

Investigation identified these issues (prioritized):

### CRITICAL

1. **Unbounded query invalidation during discovery** (`ui/src/lib/features/discovery/queries.ts:374-378`)
   - `DiscoverySSEManager` invalidates ALL hosts/services/subnets/daemons on EVERY progress update
   - Each invalidation triggers full refetch of all data with nested entities
   - During active discovery, this happens many times per second

2. **Host tab fetches unlimited data** (`ui/src/lib/features/hosts/components/HostTab.svelte:37`)
   - Uses `limit: 0` fetching ALL hosts with nested interfaces, ports, services
   - Data duplicated across 4 separate caches (hosts + interfaces + ports + services)

3. **Request cache accumulates** (`ui/src/lib/api/client.ts:57-78`)
   - 250ms debounce window insufficient during rapid discovery invalidations
   - Cloned Response objects pile up faster than cleanup

### HIGH

4. **No debounce on SSE message handler** (`ui/src/lib/features/discovery/queries.ts:364-445`)
   - Query invalidations run synchronously on every SSE event
   - No throttling before invalidating queries

5. **DataControls re-processes full dataset** (`ui/src/lib/shared/components/data/DataControls.svelte:295-419`)
   - `processedItems` derived state re-runs expensive filter/sort/group on every update
   - With 10,000+ hosts, each invalidation re-processes entire list

### MEDIUM

6. **LastProgress map not cleaned** (`ui/src/lib/features/discovery/queries.ts:361,417`)
   - Map entries persist if session doesn't reach terminal phase

## Requirements

1. Debounce/throttle discovery SSE invalidations - batch instead of firing on every progress update
2. Add pagination or limits to host queries - don't fetch unlimited data
3. Clear discovery-related caches when sessions complete
4. Clean up lastProgress map on SSE disconnect
5. Consider memoization for DataControls filter/sort operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Discovery session with 1000+ hosts doesn't cause unbounded memory growth
- [ ] Memory usage stays under ~500MB for typical usage
- [ ] Query invalidations are debounced (e.g., max 1 per second during discovery)
- [ ] Host tab uses pagination or reasonable limits
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] `cd ui && npm test` passes
- [ ] `make format && make lint` passes

## Files Likely Involved

- `ui/src/lib/features/discovery/queries.ts` - SSE manager, query invalidation
- `ui/src/lib/features/hosts/components/HostTab.svelte` - Host query limits
- `ui/src/lib/features/hosts/queries.ts` - Host query configuration
- `ui/src/lib/api/client.ts` - Request cache cleanup
- `ui/src/lib/shared/components/data/DataControls.svelte` - Data processing

## Notes

- Focus on the CRITICAL issues first - they likely account for most of the memory bloat
- Test with browser dev tools Memory tab to verify improvements
- Don't over-engineer - simple debouncing and limits should fix the worst issues

## Work Summary

### Changes Implemented

**Backend:**
- Added `ids` query parameter to `NetworkFilterQuery` and `HostChildQuery` in `backend/src/server/shared/handlers/query.rs` to enable selective entity loading

**Frontend - SSE Throttling:**
- Added 1-second throttle to `DiscoverySSEManager` query invalidations in `ui/src/lib/features/discovery/queries.ts`
- Added cleanup of pending invalidation timer and lastProgress map on disconnect

**Frontend - Host/Service Pagination and Selective Loading:**
- Added `useHostsByIds` hook in `ui/src/lib/features/hosts/queries.ts` for selective host loading
- Added `useServicesByIds` hook in `ui/src/lib/features/services/queries.ts` for selective service loading
- Added pagination support to `useServicesQuery` with `ServicesQueryParams` interface
- Changed `HostTab.svelte` to use `limit: 25` and selective service lookup for "Virtualized By" field
- Changed `ServiceTab.svelte` to use `limit: 25` and selective host lookup for host name display

**Frontend - Remove Expensive Card Computations:**
- Removed `hostGroups` computation from `HostTab.svelte`
- Removed `useHostsQuery`, VMs field, and Groups field from `HostCard.svelte`
- Removed hosts display from `NetworkCard.svelte` and hosts query from `NetworksTab.svelte`
- Removed services display from `SubnetCard.svelte` and hosts/services queries from `SubnetTab.svelte`

**Frontend - Request Cache Improvements:**
- Increased `DEBOUNCE_MS` from 250 to 500 in `ui/src/lib/api/client.ts`
- Added `MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 50` with enforcement in cleanup to prevent unbounded cache growth

### Verification

- Backend tests: PASS (3 passed, 0 failed)
- Frontend type check: PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Lint: PASS (format + eslint + svelte-check all clean)

### Components That Still Load All Data (Acceptable)

The following load on-demand when opened:
- **Modals:** HostConsolidationModal, GroupEditModal, VirtualizationForm, VmManagerConfigPanel
- **TopologyTab:** Needs complete graph data (future optimization candidate)
